### 3. **🌿 Create a New Branch**
It’s best to work in a separate branch to keep your changes organized and isolated.

1. Create a new branch with a name that describes your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```
2. Double-check that you’re in your new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
3. You’re ready to go! 🛠️

### 4. **🛠️ Make Your Changes**
Let your creativity shine! 🌟 Make the changes you want—whether it’s fixing a bug, adding functionality, or improving the code.

1. Check what files you’ve modified:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. Stage your changes to prepare them for commit:
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   # Or add everything:
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit your changes with a clear and friendly message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "🌟 Added a cool new feature!"
   ```

---

### 5. **📤 Push Your Changes**
Let’s send your work to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
```

---

### 6. **🔄 Create a Pull Request to `master`**
This is the exciting part—sharing your changes with the team! 🎉

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Switch to your branch (`feature/my-awesome-feature`).
3. Click the **Compare & pull request** button.
4. In the Pull Request form:
   - Make sure the **Base repository** is the original repo (`brgman/agenda42`).
   - Set the **Base branch** to `master`.
   - Select your **Head branch** (`feature/my-awesome-feature`).
5. Add a title and description to explain your changes. Be creative! ✨
6. Click **Create pull request**, and voilà! Your changes are now up for review. 🎉

### 7. **🔃 Keep Your Fork Updated**
As the project evolves, it’s important to keep your fork synchronized with the original repository:

1. Add the original repository as `upstream`:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/brgman/agenda42.git
   ```
2. Fetch updates from the original repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
3. Merge the updates into your local `master` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```
4. Push the updated `master` to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
